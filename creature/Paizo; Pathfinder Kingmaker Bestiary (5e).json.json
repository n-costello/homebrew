Longer barbed vines snake out from this central mass to give the deadly plant two dangerous methods of attack. The plant’s berries are something of an acquired taste, but among some cultures, wine made from these berries can be quite popular. Mature assassin vines grow to 20 feet long and have smaller vines extending off the main trunk that reach from to 5 to 10 feet in length."
